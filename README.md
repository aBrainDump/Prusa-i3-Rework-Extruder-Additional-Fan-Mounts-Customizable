Prusa-i3-Rework-Extruder-Additional-Fan-Mounts-Customizable
===========================================================

Add one or two additional fan duct mounts to the extruder hotend mounting screws (15mm center to center).  I created this adapter that mounts on the hotend screws and provides a pivot point. This allows you to add two additional fans to this extruder by mounting one on the left and one on the right of the hotend.
